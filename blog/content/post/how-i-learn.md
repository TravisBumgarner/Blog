### Motivation

Before I'd really cemented my process of "learning how to learn", I embarked on an ambitious project, my first large electronics project, documented [here]({{< ref "/project/combining-hobbies">}}). It involved soldering, programming in C++, connecting various electrical components together, and designing a user interface, consisting of buttons and a screen, through which to interact with the device. One day, while working on the project, a bug somewhere in the code or an issue with the circuit. I spent nearly 6 hours throughout my weekend floundering around finally stumbling upon the issue. On Tuesday, I went to my [meetup](http://www.cambridgehackspace.com/) for makers where I asked Rich how he would have diagnosed the problem. Without pause, he said, "I would have checked X and Y to see that they were done correctly." The details aren't important, but that was exactly what I discovered after those 6 painful hours. 

### Background

Back in 2015, I knew almost nothing about anything that I claim to know something about these days. In college, I studied mechanical engineering, where I struggled and failed to understand anything my professors talked about in my electrical engineering and programming classes. After graduating, I joined the Peace Corps, working as a Civil Engineer but did not learn much related to the subject as the tasks weren't too deep.

What I did begin to develop was, what I called it, "learning how to learn".
