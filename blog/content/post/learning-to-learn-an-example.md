 ### Project Motivation

In my [Previous Post](/post/learning-to-learn), I introduced the topic of __Learning to Learn__. I decided to make this project. 
 
Here's how I did it.

### I did some Research

My first step was to explore what exists these days. I'm already having quite familiar with blogging platforms, having spent several years writing a [Travel Blog](http://mytravelsin.blogspot.com/) with Blogger and using WordPress as a platform to build a lot of my early sites. I started with the easy solution of using one of those two platforms. However, as a developer, I like a challenge and have a few issues with the two, so I decided to look elsewhere. I landed on Using the WordPress API platform with React, Hugo, or Gatbsy. Indecisive, I moved on to the next step.

### I Reached Out to my community. 

Two of my coworkers blog. I've read several of their posts and I like their blogs so I decided to reach out. Both of them use [Hugo](http://hugo.io). What did they think about it? They loved it. Well that was easy. Hugo it is.

### I avoided Analysis Paralysis

I found a tool that sounded decent and decided to move forward, even though I knew almost nothing about it. 

### I struggled, Seriously

This is a bit of a tangent here. People assume that if they just had my camera, they'd take pictures as good as I do. Or if they had skill X, they'd be able to program as good as I am. I get the impression, and it frustrates me, that people think these things come naturally to me and that they can't do it themselves. That's not true. Not one bit. 

There's this voice in the back of my mind when tackling projects like this. He's pretty consistent and he's pretty loud. 

- "Why bother?"
- "Pick the easy route." 
- "This is too hard." 
- "No one cares about your blog anyways."

He likes to repeat himself.
