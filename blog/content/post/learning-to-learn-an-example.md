Process of building notes
Questions to SA, video tutorials
Try and walk myself through as if it was present tense
Perhaps peak at git history
Photo, perhaps posed of notes taken
Focus on learnin tie things to the various sections of the original article
Alternative title - how I create
Recursive learning example perhaps with the metadata phrase to keep it simple and relatable
Paralysis - jumped right in and started playing around. Took about a week, realized at worst I still have all the content and can migrate elsewhere

 ### Motivation

When I set out to build this blog, I had my original post about [Learning to Learn](/post/learning-to-learn) in mind. In that post, I discussed all the methods I have developed over the years to more effectively learn new subjects. I thought what could be a better method to demonstrate those experiences than documenting how I applied Learning to Learn to build this blog. This is the Trip Report and roughly the steps that I took to get from novice to functioning blog.

### Research & Analysis Paralysis

My first step was to explore the alternatives. For beginners, I advised doing a little bit of planning and research. If this was my first blog, I probably, (and I actually did), opt for WordPress. However, I'm already quite familiar with blogging platforms. I spent several years writing a [Travel Blog](http://mytravelsin.blogspot.com/) with Blogger and have used WordPress as a platform to build several of my early websites. I began my exploration with these two platforms. The initial contenders were Blogger, WordPress API + React, Hugo, and Gatsby. 

As a developer and lifelong learner, I like a challenge and decided against Blogger.

WordPress API and React looked appealing but I feared I'd spend way too much time building out the site. I'd then be too exhausted to acutually write. I realized that I wanted a platform that I could easily and fully customize for what I needed but that didnt require too much setup.

### Community

Research left Gatsby and Hugo as the two contenders. However, I knew almost nothing about them and the documentation and articles I looked at didn't feel so helpful.

I decided to give my network a try.

Two of my coworkers blog. I've read several of their posts and I like their blogs so I reached out. Both of them use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). What did they think about it? They loved it. Well that was easy. Hugo it is.

### Designing & Coding & Learning

Alright. I have a platform. I know two people to reach out to for help. (But I won't bug them first, remember, a bit of struggle is important. If you're lost here, go back and read [Learning to Learn](/post/learning-to-learn)!) Now what? Nothing about how I learn is linear. Hopefully, you'll gain something interesting from this section!

Time to find a tutorial. It's always exciting to find out that a new technology has great documentation. I headed to the Hugo website and ran through the quick start tutorial. 

Post interesting questions here:



Random questions started popping into my head and I took lots of tangents. As they came to mind, I'd research them.




### Struggle

This is a bit of a tangent here. People assume that if they just had my camera, they'd take pictures as good as I do. Or if they had skill X, they'd be able to program as good as I am. I get the impression, and it frustrates me, that people think these things come naturally to me and that they can't do it themselves. That's not true. Not one bit. 

There's this voice in the back of my mind when tackling projects like this. He's pretty consistent and he's pretty loud. 

- "Why bother?"
- "Pick the easy route." 
- "This is too hard." 
- "No one cares about your blog anyways."

He likes to repeat himself.
