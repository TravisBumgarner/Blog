### Filler

God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs. This thing comes fully loaded. AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats, and... power windows. They're using our own satellites against us. And the clock is ticking.

Checkmate... I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A computer virus. I was part of something special. Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend. Checkmate... Forget the fat lady! You're obsessed with the fat lady! Drive us out of here! So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs?
