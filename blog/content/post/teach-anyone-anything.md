I'll be blunt, subject matter experts, such as engineers, are bad teachers. 

As an undergrad, I studied mechanical engineering. After graduating. I returned visited a friend who was still there. He was getting his masters in a specific area of mechanical engineering. I stopped by his lab to check out what he was doing. After I got an explination, I left the lab, still not sure what he did. From kindergarten up through garudating college together, we took the same classes. Yet, with all the knowledge and vocabulary we shared, he was unable to explain what he did. 

I used to be one of those bad teachers. I used to fail to understand who I was talking to, empathize with their experience, and adjust what I said accordingly. I have also been on the receiving end of bad explinations. 

Over the last few years, I focused on improving my expliantion. I have developed skills to become a better teacher and hope to share those tips here.

### Before we Start

Pick a technical word that you feel you're an expert on and define it to yourself. For programming, I'd go with `string`. For electronics, I'd go with `resistor`.  Jot down or keep your answer in mind. As you move through each section, think about your answer and how you might adjust it. 

### Domain Specific Terminology

{{< figure src="/image/teach-anyone-anything/cinnova.jpg" title="Teaching Electronics" >}}

In 2016 I was invited to lead a student trip from MIT to Bogota, Colombia to work at a hackspace for 3 weeks. As part of the experience, students were asked to develop a workshop they could teach. Several of students decided to make projects around the [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Introduction), an electronics platform. All of them were applications of the Arduino. However, none of them were an introduction to the tool. At the time, I was teaching an Introduction to Arduino workshop at the Cambridge Hackspace so I decided to translate it to Spanish and teach it. 

I speak Spanish but didn't have a good grasp on the vocabulary needed for the workshop. I set out to make flash cards for all of the words I would need to learn. At some point in this process, someone asked me - why are you looking up these words? Why not just use the words you already know? It was a bit of an aha moment. My Spanish vocabulary is much smaller than my English vocabulary. I definitely didn't know any electronics vocabulary. Without knowing the technical words, I'd be forced to search for alternative descriptions. 

Around the time I was asked that question, I was struggling to find a translation for a "for loop". For those that don't know, a for loop is a programming term for something that repeats itself a specified number of times. For example, you could consider the process of counting allowd from 0 to 10 to be a for loop. You start at 0, say the number, increase by 1, and keep repeating until you hit 10. For the programmers reading this, place yourself in non-programmers shoes's for a second. For non-programmers - I bet the actual definition was easier to understand than just dropping the technical term and moving on. 

### Snowball Effect of Doom

Imagine I hadn't used the longer definition of a for loop in my workshop. I would have continued to reference the term throughout the rest of the talk. At some point, I would use the term as part of the definiton of another term. What started out as my inability to explain a single term has snowballed in to the next term. This snowball is getting bigger. At some point, I'll start losing the attention of people in the room. For the remainder of the workshop, they'll check out mentally. Some of them might blame me for being a bad teacher. That would suck. Even worse though is others deciding they're too stupid to understand electronics and abandon the subject altogether. That would be awful.

### Patronizing Effect of Doom

It's probably obvious that you can talk above someone's experience level. However, the opposite is also possible. It's probably not a good idea to give an electrical engineer a 10 minute explination of what a for loop is.

### Gauge Your Audience and Adjust Acordingly

So how do we avoid these effects?

Each year, Cambridge hosts a science festival where they invite local organizations to setup tables and share what they're working on. I went one time to represent the Cambridge Hackspace. We filled our table with various projects including everything from electronics to woodworking. A child, probably about 7 years old, approached our table. He was curious about all the flashing lights. One particular electronics project caught his eye and he asked what it was. I was in the middle of talking to someone else so another person at the table stepped in to answer - "It's a device for visually measuring decibel levels."

I could almost hear the whoosh as the explination passed right over his head. Curiosity killed. He turned and walked away. If the explination had been for a fellow maker, it would have been perfect. However, for a 7 year old, I would have opted for something along the lines of "it lights up when you make noise."

It's important to tailor what you say to your audience. If you already know your audience, problem solved. If not, this can be gained in a few different ways.

The first is passively from the context of the interaction. If they're 7 years old, they probably don't have a degree in electrical engineering. If you're meeting them at the International Convention for Electrical Engineering, you can probably assume they know a bit more. 

People attending the science festival, in terms of experience fell somewhere between that 7 year old and an International Convention for Electrical Engineering attendee. I needed a bit more of an understanding about their backgrounds. Two questions I would have used first would have been "How much do you know about electronics and/or music?" and "How much of an explination would you like?"

Some people have no experience but want to know everything. Others have differing levels of interest, patience, and experiene for what you're about to tell them.  

### How to Appeal to a Larger Audience?

Now that you know how to talk to individual learners, how to address a larger audience?

In my Intro to Arduino workshop, I'll get attendees with varying degrees of experience. There will be a person who wants to learn how to include lights in the clothing they make with no electronics background. Another attendee works as a mechanical engineer and took one electronics course in college. To reach everyone, I like to keep my workshops open ended and cater to each level of experience. I created the material so that the slowest learner would still be able to enjoy all of it. For those that moved faster, I added extra challeneges. As an example, in the first section, the goal is to make a light blink on and off. For those that finish early, I'd challenge them to make multiple lights blink together.  

### Remove the Blame

"Do you understand?" is an awful question to ask. It almost always leads to two outcomes. They'll either say yes because they understand or yes because they don't want to embarrass themselves. Remove "you" from the question and rephrase it - "Did I explain that well?". Even better would be to ask open ended questions to see if they've understood what you said. This will give you the chance to try for an alternative explination if you realize they didn't understand.

### Get Feedback

A few years ago I attended the International Design & Development Summit with MIT in Cali, Colombia. There was lots of down time in the evenings so we started giving random presentations on subjects of our choosing. I decided to do an Introduction to Photography. It was my first not only teaching photography but also teaching a heavily technical subject in Spanish. 

At the end of the talk, I asked an attendee I was close with what he thought. He told me I skipped the introduction and dove right into the technical deepend. I talked about aperture, shutter speed, white balance, ISO, noise, and other complex subjects - in the span of 10 minutes. I lost everybody the moment I opened my mouth.

In that moment, I realized that I hadn't gauged my audience very well. This past week, I again gave a another Introduction to Photography talk. This time, instead, I focused on the basics and spoke about 6 easily understandable tips for creating better photos. 

### Practice Empathy

Think back to a time that you got lost in a conversation for whatever reason. That's exactly what it feels like to be on the receiving end of a bad explination. That's all.

### Call to Action

Now think back to the explination you gave about a word in your field. How would you phrase your expliantion differently now? 

I'd love to hear what strategies you've used to teach others.
