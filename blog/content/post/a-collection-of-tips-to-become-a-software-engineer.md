Introduction
-really good at interviewing
- lots of resume reviews

### The Resume

#### Format & Design

- **Make it Screenable** 
    - Ask a friend to imagine they are screening resumes and they have 30 seconds to review a resume and learn as much as possible about a candidate. Give them your resume and see how much they can get from it.
    - There should be a visual hierarchy on the page. Sections like education, skills, and work experience should be separated. Within a section, such as work experience the company, job title, and period worked should all be easily identifiable.
- **Put some effort into the format** 
    - Be consistent with styling - if you use a solid circle for a bullet point, use it for every section. If the title of a section is bold and uppercase, make every section bold and uppercase.
    - A good rule I've heard in the past and have stuck to is that a resume should have no more than 4 unique styles for text. Each style includes a combination of uppercase/lowercase, font name, and underline/italics/bold. 

#### Content

- **Keep it to One Page** 
    - Some people argue that two pages resumes are fine. Others argue that it should be one page. Both groups of people would agree that there is nothing wrong with a one page resume. Keep it to one page, appeal to everybody. 
- **Show, Don't Tell**
    - Instead of listing a skill like "well organized", put some effort into the display of your resume.
- **Be Prepared to Talk About it** 
    - If it's on your resume, be expected to talk about it.
    - If you're learning it or know it and are able to talk about it put it on there. Otherwise, take it out.
- **Be the ideal candidate the employer is looking for**
    - I used to think that a resume was a summation of all the awesome things I've done in my life. But I was wrong. The employer is looking for a specific kind of skill set to fill a role. Write your resume so that you can best demonstrate how your background makes you the best fit. The only point of a resume is to get yourself an invitation for your first interview.
- **Make past experience relevant**
    - Most jobs involve switching industries or moving between different companies. Jargon and technologies that make sense at one job might mean nothing at the next. Place yourself in the interviewer's shoes and adjust your skills so that they understand even if they don't have a background in the company or industry you're coming from.

### The Process

- **It's a marathon not a sprint**
    - Keep to a routine and don't burn yourself out. 
    - I tried to apply to at least 3 jobs a day Monday to Friday and didn't job search on the weekend. Every Tuesday and Thursday I'd try and connect with at least 1 or 2 connections on LinkedIn. 
- **Stay positive and don't take it personally**
    - A wise bit of advise I heard in my job search was "you can't be everything to everyone". You can't connect with everyone out there. The right job is waiting for you.
    - Budgets run out. interviewers and interviewees have off days. Things happen. 
- **Use every interview as a learning opportunity**
    - Every question I didn't know the answer to, I'd make a mental note of and learn it later. 
    - If you don't get a position, ask politely what you can improve on. Not everyone can or will give feedback but it never hurts to ask. 
- **Treat everyone with respect**
    - Show up on a few minutes early.
    - Be polite.
    - Say please and thank you.
