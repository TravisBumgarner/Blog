### Background

Before I really developed the ability to "learn how to learn", I embarked on an ambitious project to build a camera so that I could learn more about how electronics worked. It involved connecting various electrical components together, programming in C++, soldering, and building a little user interface to interact with it.

One Saturday afternoon, while working on the project, i encountered a bug somewhere in the code or an issue with the circuit. I spent nearly 6 hours throughout the remainder of my weekend struggling and then eventually finding the solution. On Tuesday, I went to a [meetup for makers](http://www.cambridgehackspace.com/) I frequented where I asked a fellow maker how he would have diagnosed the problem. Without pause, he said, "I would have checked X and Y to see that they were connected correctly." The details aren't important, but that was exactly what I discovered after those 6 painful hours. 

In the pursuit of learning about electronics and other subjects, I have developed a set of skills that have enabled me to learn new subjects more quickly and thoroughly and with less frustration. For me, learning new subjects is now much more rewarding and enjoyable than it used to be and I hope that I can share some of what I have learned with you.

### Avoid Analysis Paralysis and Just Get Going

I see a lot of beginner programmers ask questions like "What's the best language to learn?". They'll then spend weeks reading about each language, weighing the pros and cons, not writing a single line of code, then giving up on programming altogether. Spending all your time planning which way you'll go instead of just going can be a dangerous thing. I suggest pick a direction and go. Even if you start moving the wrong way, you'll take away something from the experience and can readjust yourself in the future and head in a better direction.

### Find Yourself a Good Community

Having a good community is critical to your education. As you begin to teach yourself a new subject, there is the very real chance you're teaching yourself something that could be done better or is incorrect. As the saying goes, about teaching an old dog new tricks, learning bad habits that go uncorrected can lead to some real pains later on in your journey. A community offers a place to ask questions, get feedback and critique, and help those that follow in your footsteps.

I've listed a few of my favorite communities below.

*Note*: A Bit of Struggle is a ~~Good~~ Great Thing

While 6 hours of struggling was not helpful in learning more about electronics, giving up when I first encountered the bug wouldn't have been very good either. I have found that there's a sweet spot, for me it's usually somewhere between the thirty minute and two hour mark where there is more experience to be gained than frustration to be encountered. 

{{< figure src="/image/learning-to-learn/learning-over-time.png" title="The Sweet Spot" >}}

A bit of struggling is great for two reasons. The first is that you learn to deal with frustration and the unknown. Learning a new subject, such as programming, can be quite frustrating so developing a "frustration muscle" to deal with challenging moments is helpful. Secondly, in the pursuit of solving the issue at hand causes you to consider various sources for the issue. In the process of addressing potential causes, you'll learn more about the subject, perhaps unrelated, but still valuable nonetheless.

#### Local Meetups

One of the first things I did when I moved to Boston was start attending [local meetups](https://www.meetup.com/). Meetups offer a great, generally free or cheap, space to listen to experts talk on various subjects, chat with others interested in the same subject, and work on your personal projects. There's sometimes even free food and drink! Two examples of great meetups are the [Boston Python User Group](https://www.meetup.com/bostonpython/) and the [Cambridge Hackspace](https://www.meetup.com/Cambridge-Hackspace/). 

The Python group alternates events between experts speaking on subjects (which I did [once](https://www.meetup.com/bostonpython/events/249585234/)) and project nights where people can sit at themed tables such as a table for data science where you can sit, work, and chat with likeminded individuals about a particular subject related to Python. 

At the Cambridge Hackspace, every Tuesday is open night where you can come and work, chat, drink, and generally geek out on projects. Every so often, there are introduction classes such things as [Intro to Arduino](https://www.meetup.com/Cambridge-Hackspace/events/231390053/) and Intro to Laser Cutting.

Check out the website and look for meetups in your area!

#### Friends, Family, & Coworkers

This one is pretty straight forward. Ask questions of those immediately around you! When I first moved to Boston, I took a temp job at a small electrical engineering firm. I decided to start learning about circuits and building products. I picked the brains of lots of my coworkers on subjects including assembly, circuit board design, packaging, shipping, customer support, and sales.  

#### Internet Gatherings

If for whatever reason, local meetups don't work for you, there are a pleathora of online communities to join. Of the communities I have found they range in terms of what they're useful for. Discord and Slack are great for more realtime chatroom style discussions. Reddit is great for discussions that last for a day or so. Forums, are great for longer lasting more focussed discussions. 

Discord - I generally only use Discord for voice chat with friends but I have noticed lots of people online discussing discord as a great place to find a community. A quick search termed up [this site](https://discord.me/) which looks like a good resource to find a Discord Community for you.

Slack - This is similar to Discord in that I almost only use it for work. However, I have searched around Google and found a few interesting communities related to subjects i'm interested in. 

Forums - 

Reddit - There's a discussion for everything today. For example, in the realm of programming, there's discussion

Slack Groups

### Find Great Teaching Resources

In my opinion, one of the most amazing things about the internet is the sheer amount of content there is out there to consume. Compounding the quantity of content is the rating systems that usually go along with them to tell you whether said content is worthwhile or not. 

Stack Overflow


#### Books

Amazon is one of my favorite places to go to purchase books. My method is pretty simple, say I want to learn something like Python. I'll simply search for "Python", click on a few of the most highly rated books, read the descriptions and reviews, and make a purchase. Only once has this strategy failed me and I ended up with a book I didn't enjoy. Otherwise, I have a several bookshelves full of excellent books on subjects ranging from photography to low level programming. 

#### Recorded Video Content

YouTube, Pluralsight, Udemy, Edx, Lynda


#### Live Video Content

Twitch - Twitch is perhaps an unexpcted item on this list. While I mainly use the platform to watch others play video games for enjoyment, I have also watched pros to learn how to play better. Beyond video games, you can also watch people playing music, painting, and programming - all live!

### Recursive Learning

A few years back I worked for a Pharmacutical Company as a software engineer. Day 1, I was completely lost in conversations outside of software, biology and chemistry were not my strengths in high school. I struggled to understand what the company did, so I went and read their About Me page. Unfortunately, I left the page more lost than before I arrived. 

I decided to use the About Me page as a starting point and look up each of the words I didn't know. I then looked up those words and kept going until I had a decent enough understanding of it all that I could explain to friends and family what the company did. 

I must note, the process of looking up the words didn't always end up in me going to a dictionary - that actually wasn't usually the best idea. Would you go to a dictionary to learn the parts of a guitar? Probably not. Instead, utilize all of the resources I've listed above - no matter how small the thing you're trying to learn great explinations exist out there. 

### Know When to Take a Break

burnout
teeth grinding
complete apathy
Don't brute force it

### Know When to Quit

For the longest time, I struggled with the word failure. Growing up, we come to see failure as something that should be avoided at all costs. Equating it with a lack of effort. Failing something such as a math test was just unacceptable. However, As I started experiencing life after the classroom, I realized that there's more to the term than what we were raised on. One can put their best into something such as a new business and it still may fail. That doesn't mean they didn't try their best or that there was a lack of effort, sometimes these things happens. 

Sometimes learning a new subject doesn't work out. For as many things I've succeeded at, there's an equal number of failures - gardening, painting, drawing, and playing the guitar. 

More words yada yada. 

Be comfortable with failure
Just not for you
Give it your best


### Pat Yourself on the Back

I think Shawn Achor's TEDx talk on _The Happy Secret to Better Work_ puts it better than I can, so I'll leave it to him.

> And I found that most companies and schools follow a formula for success, which is this: If I work harder, I'll be more successful. And if I'm more successful, then I'll be happier. That undergirds most of our parenting and managing styles, the way that we motivate our behavior.

> And the problem is it's scientifically broken and backwards for two reasons. Every time your brain has a success, you just changed the goalpost of what success looked like. You got good grades, now you have to get better grades, you got into a good school and after you get into a better one, you got a good job, now you have to get a better job, you hit your sales target, we're going to change it. And if happiness is on the opposite side of success, your brain never gets there.

### Share Your Progress and Product With the World & Give Back

I always told myself that one day, in all of the knowledge I was acquiring from the efforts of others, that I'd give back to those following the path I just walked. I ask that as you learn, share what you have learned with others. It doesn't necessarily have to be direct teaching - you could do write-ups about projects you work on, share posts on Instagram and reply to comments, or whatever else works for you.
