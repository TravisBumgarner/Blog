### Background

Four years ago, while looking for jobs after I finished my Peace Corps service, I stumbled upon a listing asking for a portfolio either as a PDF or website. I knew almost nothing about software development and like any rational person, opted to build a website to showcase my talents and experience. The journey was far from easy. However, I have developed a set of skills that have enabled me to learn new subjects and I'd like to share them with you.

Before I'd really cemented my process of "learning how to learn", I embarked on an ambitious project, my first large electronics project, documented [here]({{< ref "/project/combining-hobbies">}}). It involved soldering, programming in C++, connecting various electrical components together, and designing a user interface, consisting of buttons and a screen, through which to interact with the device. 

### Develop a Support Network

I have personally found that when I learn new subjects, I like to find a project I am excited about and throw myself into the deepend. The easiest way I've found to do this is find another hobby I'm passionate about and use that as the focus. In this case, I decided to build a camera. One day, while working on it, I encountered a issue somewhere in the code or with the circuit. I spent nearly 6 hours throughout my weekend floundering around finally stumbling upon the solution. On Tuesday, I went to my weekly meetup for makers where I asked a fellow maker how he would have diagnosed the problem. Without pause, he said, "I would have checked X and Y to see that they were done correctly." The details aren't important, but that was exactly what I discovered after those 6 painful hours. It is super important, especially when initially embarking on learning a completely unknown subject, to have places to go to get quick answers. 

#### Remember: A Bit of Struggle is a ~~Good~~ Great Thing

While 6 hours of struggling was not helpful in learning more about electronics giving up when I first encountered the bug wouldn't have been very helpful either. I have found that there's a sweet spot, usually somewhere between the thirty minute and two hour mark where there is more experience to be gained than frustration to be encountered. 

{{< figure src="/image/learning-to-learn/learning-over-time.png" title="The Sweet Spot" >}}

Two reasons - learn to exercise the frustration muscle, learn more about the subject. 

#### Find Yourself a Good Community

Having a good community is critical to your education. As you begin to teach yourself a new subject, there is the very real chance you're teaching yourself something incorrect. As the saying goes, about teaching an old dog new tricks, learning bad habits that go uncorrected can lead to some real pains later on in your learning journey. A community offers a place to ask questions, get feedback and critique, and help those that follow in your footsteps.

If you're struggling to think of a good community to join, below are a few of mine.

##### Local Meetups

One of the first things I did when I moved to Boston was start attending [local meetups](https://www.meetup.com/). Meetups offer a great, generally free or cheap, space to listen to experts talk on various subjects, chat with others interested in the same subject, and work on your personal projects. There's sometimes even free food and drink! Two examples of great meetups are the [Boston Python User Group](https://www.meetup.com/bostonpython/) and the [Cambridge Hackspace](https://www.meetup.com/Cambridge-Hackspace/). 

The Python group alternates events between experts speaking on subjects (which I did [once](https://www.meetup.com/bostonpython/events/249585234/)) and project nights where people can sit at themed tables such as a table for data science where you can sit, work, and chat with likeminded individuals about a particular subject related to Python. 

At the Cambridge Hackspace, every Tuesday is open night where you can come and work, chat, drink, and generally geek out on projects. Every so often, there are introduction classes such things as [Intro to Arduino](https://www.meetup.com/Cambridge-Hackspace/events/231390053/) and Intro to Laser Cutting.

Check out the website and look for meetups in your area!

##### Friends, Family, & Coworkers

This one is pretty straight forward. Ask questions of those immediately around you! When I first moved to Boston, I took a temp job at a small electrical engineering firm. I decided to start learning about circuits and building products. I picked the brains of lots of my coworkers on subjects including assembly, circuit board design, packaging, shipping, customer support, and sales.  

##### Internet Gatherings

If for whatever reason, local meetups don't work for you, there are a pleathora of online communities to join.

Discord

Forums

Reddit

Slack Groups

### Find the Best Resources

In my opinion, one of the most amazing things about the internet is the sheer amount of content there is out there to consume. Compounding the quantity of content is the rating systems that usually go along with them to tell you whether said content is worthwhile or not. 

Stack Overflow


#### Books

Amazon is one of my favorite places to go to purchase books. My method is pretty simple, say I want to learn something like Python. I'll simply search for "Python", click on a few of the most highly rated books, read the descriptions and reviews, and make a purchase. Only once has this strategy failed me and I ended up with a book I didn't enjoy. Otherwise, I have a several bookshelves full of excellent books on subjects ranging from photography to low level programming. 

#### Recorded Video Content

YouTube, Pluralsight, Udemy, Edx, Lynda


#### Live Video Content

Twitch - Twitch is perhaps an unexpcted item on this list. While I mainly use the platform to watch others play video games for enjoyment, I have also watched pros to learn how to play better. Beyond video games, you can also watch people playing music, painting, and programming - all live!

### Recursive Learning
how I learned about pharmacusticals, DNA, RNA

### Know When to Take a Break

burnout
teeth grinding
complete apathy
Don't brute force it

### Know When to Quit

For the longest time, I struggled with the word failure. Growing up, we come to see failure as something that should be avoided at all costs. Equating it with a lack of effort. Failing something such as a math test was just unacceptable. However, As I started experiencing life after the classroom, I realized that there's more to the term than what we were raised on. One can put their best into something such as a new business and it still may fail. That doesn't mean they didn't try their best or that there was a lack of effort, sometimes these things happens. 

Sometimes learning a new subject doesn't work out. For as many things I've succeeded at, there's an equal number of failures - gardening, painting, drawing, and playing the guitar. 

More words yada yada. 

Be comfortable with failure
Just not for you
Give it your best

### Know the Goal

What's your goal
fun
career

### Don't Forget to Give Back

I always told myself that one day, in all of the knowledge I was acquiring from the efforts of others, that I'd give back to those following the path I just walked. I ask that as you learn, share what you have learned with others. It doesn't necessarily have to be direct teaching - you could do write-ups about projects you work on, share posts on Instagram and reply to comments, or whatever else works for you. 

Share with the world

mentor others

etc
