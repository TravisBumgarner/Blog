### Background

Before I really developed the ability to "learn how to learn", I embarked on an ambitious project to build a camera so that I could learn more about how electronics worked. It involved connecting various electrical components together, programming in C++, soldering, and building a little user interface to interact with it. 

{{< instagram BH2T0sbjC7P hidecaption >}}

One Saturday afternoon, while working on the project, i encountered a bug somewhere in the code or an issue with the circuit. I spent nearly 6 hours throughout the remainder of my weekend struggling and then eventually finding the solution. On Tuesday, I went to a [meetup for makers](http://www.cambridgehackspace.com/) I frequented where I asked a fellow maker how he would have diagnosed the problem. Without pause, he said, "I would have checked X and Y to see that they were connected correctly." The details aren't important, but that was exactly what I discovered after those 6 painful hours. 

In the pursuit of learning about electronics and other subjects, I have developed a set of skills that have enabled me to learn new subjects more quickly and thoroughly and with less frustration. For me, learning new subjects is now much more rewarding and enjoyable than it used to be and I hope that I can share some of what I have learned with you.

### Avoid Analysis Paralysis and Just Get Going

I see a lot of beginner programmers ask questions like "What's the best language to learn?". They'll then spend weeks reading about each language, weighing the pros and cons, not writing a single line of code, then giving up on programming altogether. Spending all your time planning which way you'll go instead of just going can be a dangerous thing. I suggest pick a direction and go. Even if you start moving the wrong way, you'll take away something from the experience and can readjust yourself in the future and head in a better direction.

### Find Yourself a Good Community

Having a good community is critical to your education. As you begin to teach yourself a new subject, there is the very real chance you're teaching yourself something that could be done better or is incorrect. As the saying goes, about teaching an old dog new tricks, learning bad habits that go uncorrected can lead to some real pains later on in your learning journey. A community offers a place to ask questions, get feedback and critique, and eventually help those that follow in your footsteps.

**Note**: A Bit of Struggle is a ~~Good~~ Great Thing Before Approaching a Community for Help.

While 6 hours of struggling was not helpful in learning more about electronics, giving up when I first encountered the bug wouldn't have been very good either. I have found that there's a sweet spot, for me it's usually somewhere between the thirty minute and two hour mark where there is more experience to be gained than frustration to be encountered. 

{{< figure src="/image/learning-to-learn/learning-over-time.png" title="The Sweet Spot" >}}

A bit of struggling is great for two reasons. The first is that you learn to deal with frustration and the unknown. Learning a new subject, such as programming, can be quite frustrating so developing a "frustration muscle" to deal with challenging moments is helpful. Secondly, in the pursuit of solving the issue at hand causes you to consider various sources for the issue. In the process of addressing potential causes, you'll learn more about the subject, perhaps unrelated, but still valuable nonetheless.

Furthermore, asking questions that can easily be answered via a quick Google search is a great way to annoy members of the community so make sure you've tried to help yourself before asking others for help.  

#### Local Meetups

One of the first things I did when I moved to Boston was start attending local [meetups](https://www.meetup.com/). Meetups offer a great, at little or no cost, a space to listen to experts talk on various subjects, chat with others interested in the same subject, and work on your own projects. There's sometimes even free food and drink! Two examples of great meetups I enjoy are the [Boston Python User Group](https://www.meetup.com/bostonpython/) and the [Cambridge Hackspace](https://www.meetup.com/Cambridge-Hackspace/). 

The Python group alternates events between experts speaking on subjects (which I did [once](https://www.meetup.com/bostonpython/events/249585234/)) and project nights. On project nights, there are themed tables, where you can sit, work, and chat with like minded individuals about a particular subject, such as data science. 

At the Cambridge Hackspace, every Tuesday is open night where you can come and work, chat, drink, and generally geek out on projects. Every so often, there are introduction classes such things as [Intro to Arduino](https://www.meetup.com/Cambridge-Hackspace/events/231390053/) and Intro to Laser Cutting.

Check out the Meetup website and look for meetups in your area!

#### Friends, Family, & Coworkers

This one is pretty straight forward. Ask questions of those immediately around you! When I first moved to Boston, I took a temp job at a small electrical engineering firm. I decided to start learning about circuits and building products. I picked the brains of lots of my coworkers on subjects including assembly, circuit board design, packaging, shipping, customer support, and sales. Not that you have to, but I recommend giving a little something in exchange for their help, such as treating them to lunch or a bottle of alcohol. 

#### Internet Gatherings

If for whatever reason, local meetups don't work for you, there are a plethora of online communities to join. A few great platforms I've noticed for discussions include Slack, Discord, IRC, forums, and Reddit. A quick Google search for phrases such as "programming Slack communities" will turn up [lists](https://techbeacon.com/46-slack-groups-developers) like this. I imagine it shouldn't be hard to find a community that fits your interest. Keep in mind, that some communities are better than others so try a few out and see which one(s) work best for you. 

### Find Great Teaching Resources

In my opinion, one of the most amazing things about the internet is the sheer amount of content there is out there to consume. Compounding the quantity of content is the rating systems that usually go along with them to tell you whether said content is of great quality or not. 

#### Books

Amazon is one of my favorite places to go to purchase books. My method is pretty simple, say I want to learn something like Python. I'll search for "Python", click on a few of the most highly rated books, read the descriptions and reviews, and make a purchase. Only once has this strategy failed me and I ended up with a book I didn't enjoy. Otherwise, I have a several bookshelves full of excellent books on subjects ranging from photography to low level programming. 

#### Recorded Video Content

Similar to books, there is a ton of online content out there. YouTube is a free resource that includes everything from short clips to full courses. [Pluralsight](https://pluralsight.com) is a great online platform that gives you access to several thousand, several hour long, curated video courses for just a few bucks a month as well as assessments to measure your progress. If you're looking for courses that are similar to college classes, [edX](https://www.edx.org/) offers free recordings and resources from top universities like MIT and Harvard. 

#### Live Video Content

Twitch is perhaps an unexpected item on this list. While I mainly use the platform to watch others play video games for enjoyment, I have also watched pros to learn how to play better. Beyond video games, you can also watch people playing music, painting, and programming.

### Recursive Learning

A few years back I worked for a pharmaceutical company as a software engineer. Day 1, I was completely lost in conversations outside of software. Biology and chemistry were not my strengths in high school. I struggled to understand what the company did, so I went and read their about me page. Unfortunately, I left the page more lost than before I arrived. 

I decided to use the company description as a starting point and look up each of the words I didn't know. I then looked up those words and kept going until I had a decent enough understanding of it all that I could explain to friends and family what the company did. 

The process of looking up the words didn't always end up in me going to a dictionary - that actually wasn't usually the best idea. Would you go to a dictionary to learn the parts of a guitar? Probably not. Instead, utilize all of the resources I've listed above - no matter how small the thing you're trying to learn great explanations exist out there. 

Recursive learning is an important skill. Often, while teaching yourself, you won't necessarily follow a sequential order and you'll sometimes encounter concepts out of order. It's easy to get flustered in such a situation. Break an unknown down, learn the individual parts that make it up, and then work your way back towards the original unknown. It might take a bit of effort and time but it is well worth it to have a strong understanding of each concept when learning a new subject. 

### Know When to Take a Break

Burnout is a great way to semi-permanently or permanently, kill interest in a subject. A few years ago, I decided to start learn programming in pursuit of a new career. I would throw myself at it for hours on end, sometimes sitting in a cafe for 8 to 10 hours a day, heading home, and then resuming programming until the wee hours of the morning. 

I grinded my teeth often, was mentally a zombie when I finally finished for the day, and was generally a very grouchy person.

{{< figure src="/image/learning-to-learn/github.png" title="My First Burnout" >}}

Above is a chart of the code I wrote, measured via GitHub, for the year 2017. The darker the square, the more code written on that day. You can see that between Mid February and April I was coding regularly. Then I wasn't. I pushed myself too hard and for too long, burned myself out and barely wrote any code for the next several months. 

Learning a new subject can be draining and it's important to know when to take a break. Since burning myself out for the first time, I've managed to do it a few more times before finally developing some better habits since I fear if I ever burn out again, I won't return to programming. 

#### Keep an Eye on Yourself

When I used to set out for a day of learning, I'd push myself until there was nothing left in my brain and the only way to fix it was eight hours of sleep and a new day. This resulted in every weekend being super dull and full of nothing but learning and sleeping. Nowadays, instead, when I start to feel drained, I'll stop and call it a day. This leaves the rest of my afternoon open for fun and I feel accomplished and now zombie-like for the rest of the day. 

#### No Need to Work for Hours Straight

Imagine two situations - working for 5 hours straight, or working for 2 periods of 2 hours with a 1 hour break in between. For me, I achieve about as much in the same span of time. In the situation with the break, I feel better after, and fill that hour slot with something like exercise or video games. 

#### Ask For Help

Sometimes, in the middle of learning, it's a struggle to know when to stop and ask for help. I know I am a bit stubborn sometimes when it comes to asking for help. However, as mentioned above that a bit of struggle is a great thing, too much can have negative consequences. 

### Know When to Quit

For the longest time, I struggled with the word failure. Growing up, I came to see failure as something that should be avoided at all costs, equating it with a lack of effort. Failing something such as a math test was unacceptable. However, As I started experiencing life after classrooms, I realized that there's more to the term than what I was raised on. I could put my best into something such as a new business and it still might fail. That doesn't mean I didn't try my best or that there was a lack of effort, sometimes these things happen. 

Sometimes learning a new subject doesn't work out. For as many things I've succeeded at, there's an equal number of failures - gardening, painting, drawing, and playing the guitar. I like to explore and learn until I've lost interest or satisfied my curiosity. It's definitely easier said than done. Walking the line between being temporarily frustrated and permanently done is something that comes with experience and time.  

### Pat Yourself on the Back

I think Shawn Achor's TEDx talk on _The Happy Secret to Better Work_ puts it better than I can, so I'll leave it to him.

> ...And I found that most companies and schools follow a formula for success, which is this: If I work harder, I'll be more successful. And if I'm more successful, then I'll be happier. That undergirds most of our parenting and managing styles, the way that we motivate our behavior.

> And the problem is it's scientifically broken and backwards for two reasons. Every time your brain has a success, you just changed the goalpost of what success looked like. You got good grades, now you have to get better grades, you got into a good school and after you get into a better one, you got a good job, now you have to get a better job, you hit your sales target, we're going to change it. And if happiness is on the opposite side of success, your brain never gets there.

The full video is worth a watch:

**Make sure to pat yourself on the back!**

### Share Your Progress and Product With the World & Give Back

I always told myself that one day, in all of the knowledge I was acquiring from the efforts of others, that I'd give back to those following the path I walked. I ask that as you learn, share what you have learned with others. It doesn't necessarily have to be direct teaching - you could do write-ups about projects you work on, share posts on Instagram and reply to comments, or whatever else works for you.
