Brainstorm

### History

For the longest time I have wanted to create my own rendition of the lights from Stranger Things. (If you haven't watched Stranger Things, I highly recommend it. I'd link to a clip of the lights but every video on YouTube doesn't look very legal.) For whatever reason, I felt like I had to make such a thing with friends or coworkers. One morning, I decided to pitch the idea to my office to see if anyone wanted to spend lunch times working on it. I got a few co-workers involved, ordered the components, and got to working.

### Planning

I formed a Slack channel and my co-workers and I got to brainstorming. We invisioned some kind of a textbox that you could enter text into, and along the way we'd use a backend and convert the message
